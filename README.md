# Spark Tutorial

This is a tutorial that will introduce people to Apache Spark. 

It starts off with Spark Core and gradually builds functionality to answer questions posed in the presentations.

This tutorial is based on the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset that is available from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays

You need to download the data files and extract them into the dat folder in this project.
